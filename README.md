# akarui
cuda path tracer

Requires cuda 8.0 and visual studio 2015. To build, open the solution and build akarui. The other dependencies are included, so the project should just build and run on windows. To build a distributable zip file, build the 'distribute' project (rebuild if it says 'up to date').
